## Project Organization

Organize your documentation into intuitive hierarchies. Create nested folders to group related docs, apply tags for quick filtering, and use full-text search to find content instantly.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Start by creating a root folder for each project to maintain clean separation.

### Setting Up Folders and Tags

Follow these steps to organize your first project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Project Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace dashboard and click `New Folder`. Name it after your project, such as `Q4-Launch-Docs`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tags" icon="tag">
    Open a document, select the `Tags` panel, and add labels like `draft`, `review`, or `published`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search and Filter" icon="search">
    Use the global search bar to query by keyword or tag. Results appear with previews.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Document Management

Manage documents with robust version history. Track changes, restore previous versions, and schedule publishes directly from the editor.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Version Control" icon="git-branch">
    Every edit creates an automatic snapshot. View history via the `Versions` tab.

    ```yaml
    versions:
      - id: v1.0
        date: 2024-10-01
        changes: Initial draft
      - id: v1.1
        date: 2024-10-05
        changes: Added API section
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Draft Workflow" icon="edit-3">
    Toggle between draft and published modes. Preview changes before going live.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
